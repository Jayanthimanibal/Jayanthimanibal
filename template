  <h2>theory of computation</h2>
</center>  
  <p style="color:dodgerblue;">Theory of computation (TOC) is a branch of Computer Science that is concerned with how problems can be solved
 using algorithms and how efficiently they can be solved. Real-world computers perform computations that by nature run 
 like mathematical models to solve problems in systematic ways.</p>

  <h2>Alogrithms</h2>
</center>  
  <p style="color:red;">An algorithm is a well-defined sequential computational technique that accepts a value or a 
  collection of values as input and produces the output(s) needed to solve a problem. 
  Or we can say that an algorithm is said to be accurate if and only if it stops with the proper output for each input 
  instance.<p>

  <h2>Database Management</h2>
</center>  
  <p style="color:yellow;">A database management system (or DBMS) is essentially nothing more than a computerized 
  data-keeping system. Users of the system are given facilities to perform several kinds of operations on such a system for 
  either manipulation of the data in the database or the management of the database structure itself..</p>

  <h2>Artificial Intelligence and Manchine Learning</h2>
</center>  
  <p style="color:slateblue;">An “intelligent” computer uses AI to think like a human and perform tasks on its own. 
  Machine learning is how a computer system develops its intelligence. One way to train a computer to mimic human reasoning
  is to use a neural network, which is a series of algorithms that are modeled after the human brain.</p>
